To generate the documentation, use the following command in this folder: 

	$ make <target>

Where target is the extension of the file to be generated. Some common examples are 'html', 'latex', 'latexpdf' and 'epub'.

Sphinx needs to be installed in your machine to generate the documentation. Sphinx can be installed from the pip package management system for Python or from any other package management system. For further information visit: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html .
